# **Diabarical**

Diabarical is an STM32 12u unibody split alpha stagger style PCB with leafsprings tadpole mounting with a forced [15u bar](https://sneakbox.com/products/weirdkeys?variant=48065165623538) support

I wanted a way to use my 15u bars so I made this monstrosity

*It should have been called TAEQAZ, "Tiny Ass Enter", but I typo'd the file and silk so now it's TEAQAZ I guess*
